# Unseen

**Unseen** is a stealthy PaperMC plugin for Minecraft servers that keeps players hidden until they're close enough to each other. It blocks tablist visibility, silences join/quit/death messages, and kills name autocompletion to keep sneaky vibes strong.

---

## 🌟 Features

- Players only see each other within a configurable distance (default 20 blocks)
- Suppresses join, quit, and death messages for max stealth
- Disables player name autocompletion in chat so no sneaky spoilers
- Keeps the online player list a secret unless you physically spot 'em

---
